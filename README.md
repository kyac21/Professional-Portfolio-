  - Co-author on a project investigating the effects of nutritional manipulation on metabolic and hormonal responses —an upcoming Peer-Reviewed Publication 
- Case Study: "Complex Laceration with Muscle Damage in Division 1 Female Basketball Player"   
    - This case study examines the return-to-play process for a Division 1 Women's Basketball player at the University of Pittsburgh, focusing on the framework utilized for safe reintegration into in-season practices, monitored with data from Catapult technology and Hawkin Dynamics Force Plates—an upcoming Peer-Reviewed Publication. 
- Master’s Capstone: “The Relationship Between Countermovement Jump Force-Time Curve Waveforms and Associated Kinetic Variables in Female Collegiate Basketball Athletes.” 
  - Explored associations between waveform patterns and kinetic variables to enhance the utility of athlete profiling in performance and return-to-play contexts.


### Athletics:
I was a dedicated athlete in college sports, having competed as a thrower for **Hendrix College Track and Field**, where I earned a letter and made the **Southern Athletic Association (SAA) Academic Honor Roll**.

## Projects

## Lectures
### Training for Sport
These materials were developed as part of my role as a Teaching Assistant for REHSCI 1215 Exercise Physiology. Topics include periodization, overtraining, tapering, and detraining. Special thanks to Dr. Sean Crandell for his guidance and support during these lectures.

### Nutrition for Sport
Another core lecture series I led, focusing on macronutrient intake, hydration, and their effects on athletic performance. This series was also made possible with the mentorship of Dr. Sean Crandell.

## Performance Dashboards
This section highlights key performance reports, dashboards, and presentations that I have developed to analyze athlete data, monitor wellness, and assess training effectiveness. These tools were created using Power BI and Excel, combining both data visualization skills and applied sports science knowledge. 

### Example Player Dashboard
A sample player performance dashboard developed to visualize individual athlete data, including wellness trends, workload, and key performance metrics. This dashboard serves as a template for monitoring player readiness and adjusting training loads accordingly.(Built with Power BI)

### Wellness Dashboard
This dashboard tracks self-reported athlete wellness data, including sleep, soreness, stress, and overall well-being. The dashboard helps sports science staff identify trends and proactively adjust training plans to optimize recovery and performance. (Built with Power BI)

### Load Monitoring Progression Plan (Return-to-Play) – Pitt WBB
This Load Monitoring Progression Plan was developed to safely integrate a return-to-play athlete into in-season practice within a three-week timeframe. The structured progression focuses on gradual workload increases, ensuring the athlete meets performance benchmarks while minimizing injury risk.

This plan was implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Women’s Basketball Team as part of their strength & conditioning and sports science protocols.

### Load-Velocity Broad Jump Profiling Dashboard

This dashboard was built to profile para-athletes’ loaded broad jumps utilizing the 1080 Sprint. Since traditional sprint profiling is not applicable for these athletes, the broad jump served as a practical and inclusive method to assess horizontal force production under load. The goal was to better understand how each athlete generates and transfers force horizontally, providing insights to guide programming for tasks like change of direction, propulsion, and other movement strategies relevant to their sport.

### Fatigue Monitoring Dashboard

This dashboard was developed to monitor daily neuromuscular fatigue in snowboard athletes using countermovement jump (CMJ) data. Key metrics are compared against individual baselines using coefficient of variation (CV) thresholds. Meaningful changes—highlighted with directional flags—are automatically identified when daily deviations exceed the athlete’s normal variability. This allows for quick interpretation of fatigue status and supports informed return-to-snow and training decisions.
