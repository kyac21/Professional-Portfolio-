### About Me

Hello! My name is **Kya Carroll**, and I am currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Sports Science** at the **University of Pittsburgh** (expected graduation: May 2025). I also hold a **Bachelor of Arts in Health Sciences**, with distinction, and a minor in Psychology from **Hendrix College**, where I was consistently recognized on the Dean's List.

I am passionate about enhancing athletic performance, optimizing training programs, and applying sports science principles in practical settings. I am deeply committed to advancing my expertise in **strength and conditioning**, **exercise physiology**, and **sports nutrition**.

### Education:
- **Master of Science in Sports Science**, University of Pittsburgh (Expected May 2025)
- **Bachelor of Arts in Health Sciences with Distinction**, Hendrix College (2020-2024)
- **Minor in Psychology**, Hendrix College
- Additional coursework at Henderson State University and University of Arkansas at Little Rock

### Professional Experience:
- **Sports Science/Strength and Conditioning Intern** at the University of Pittsburgh's Women's Basketball program. Here, I contribute to strength and conditioning programs, focusing on injury prevention and performance enhancement.
- **Exercise Physiology Student Assistant** at the University of Pittsburgh, where I support both the lecture and lab components of the Exercise Physiology course.
- **Strength and Conditioning Intern** at **University of Nevada Las Vegas Athletics**, assisting with performance assessments and the operation of advanced sports technologies.
- I have also been involved in various internships and research opportunities, including a **Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)** at the **University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences**, where I explored metabolic data collection and presented my research at a symposium.

### Skills & Certifications:
- **Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS)** (2024-Present)
- **CPR/AED/First Aid Certified** (2024-2026)
- Proficient in Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) and various sports performance technologies (e.g., Catapult, Force Plates, Polar devices)

### Research & Contributions:
- I have contributed to significant research projects, including **Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) therapy**, **metabolic data collection**, and **glucose tolerance testing**. I am particularly interested in how **maternal undernutrition** impacts metabolic regulation in offspring, a subject I presented on at the **Central Arkansas Undergraduate Research Symposium**.

### Athletics:
I was a dedicated athlete in college sports, having competed as a thrower for **Hendrix College Track and Field**, where I earned a letter and made the **Southern Athletic Association (SAA) Academic Honor Roll**.

## Projects

## Lectures
### Training for Sport
These materials were developed as part of my role as a Teaching Assistant for REHSCI 1215 Exercise Physiology. Topics include periodization, overtraining, tapering, and detraining. Special thanks to Dr. Sean Crandell for his guidance and support during these lectures.

### Load Monitoring Progression Plan (Return-to-Play) – Pitt WBB
This Load Monitoring Progression Plan was developed to safely integrate a return-to-play athlete into in-season practice within a three-week timeframe. The structured progression focuses on gradual workload increases, ensuring the athlete meets performance benchmarks while minimizing injury risk.

This plan was implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Women’s Basketball Team as part of their strength & conditioning and sports science protocols.
