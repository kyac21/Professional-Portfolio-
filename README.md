### About Me

Hello! My name is **Kya Carroll**, and I am currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Sports Science** at the **University of Pittsburgh** (expected graduation: May 2025). I also hold a **Bachelor of Arts in Health Sciences**, with distinction, and a minor in Psychology from **Hendrix College**, where I was consistently recognized on the Dean's List.

I am passionate about enhancing athletic performance, optimizing training programs, and applying sports science principles in practical settings. I am deeply committed to advancing my expertise in **strength and conditioning**, **exercise physiology**, and **sports nutrition**.

### Education:
- **Master of Science in Sports Science**, University of Pittsburgh (Expected May 2025)
- **Bachelor of Arts in Health Sciences with Distinction**, Hendrix College (2020-2024)
- **Minor in Psychology**, Hendrix College
- Additional coursework at Henderson State University and University of Arkansas at Little Rock

### Professional Experience:
- **Sports Science/Strength and Conditioning Intern** at the University of Pittsburgh's Women's Basketball program. Here, I contribute to strength and conditioning programs, focusing on injury prevention and performance enhancement.
- **Exercise Physiology Student Assistant** at the University of Pittsburgh, where I support both the lecture and lab components of the Exercise Physiology course.
- **Strength and Conditioning Intern** at **University of Nevada Las Vegas Athletics**, assisting with performance assessments and the operation of advanced sports technologies.
- I have also been involved in various internships and research opportunities, including a **Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)** at the **University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences**, where I explored metabolic data collection and presented my research at a symposium.

### Skills & Certifications:
- **Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS)** (2024-Present)
- **CPR/AED/First Aid Certified** (2024-2026)
- Proficient in Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) and various sports performance technologies (e.g., Catapult, Force Plates, Polar devices)

### Research & Contributions:
- I have contributed to significant research projects, including **Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) therapy**, **metabolic data collection**, and **glucose tolerance testing**. I am particularly interested in how **maternal undernutrition** impacts metabolic regulation in offspring, a subject I presented on at the **Central Arkansas Undergraduate Research Symposium**.

### Athletics:
I was a dedicated athlete in college sports, having competed as a thrower for **Hendrix College Track and Field**, where I earned a letter and made the **Southern Athletic Association (SAA) Academic Honor Roll**.
